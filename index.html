<h2> What not to do </h2> 
 <p> Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is important that we all quarantine. That doesn't mean we cannot picnic, it just means we cant be near others. So, do not
   invite any friends to this picnic. To be honest there are many things you shouldn't do, like jump out the window. But the main thing here is staying safe.
<h2> What to do </h2>  
<p> You should make sure you bring the necessary materials and prepare. Make sure to check the weather and go on a sunny day, also make sure to bring hand sanitizer
  so that you can rid your hand of germs before you eat. Talking about eating, definetly bring sadnwhiches. Dont know how to? Read the next seccion.

<p>  To make a sandwhich you get any amount of slices of bread you want as long as its more than one and is a whole number of bread(no halfes). Put anything eatable in
